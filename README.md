Sexual Harassment Law Penalties on Non-Compliance

What is the posh act, also known as the sexual harassment law?
 
By order in writing, any organisation with ten (ten) or more employees must form an Internal Complaints Committee, according to the PoSH Act or Sexual Harassment Law. The ICC will have sufficient authority to investigate sexual harassment law complaints and resolve them in accordance with the PoSH Act and PoSH Rules.


Penalties for non-compliance with the sexual harassment law
•	Failure to comply with the POSH act can result in serious consequences, including:
•	If an employer fails to form an internal committee or violates the POSH Act's regulations, they are liable for a fine of fifty thousand rupees (INR 50,000).
•	If an employer has previously been convicted of an offence punishable under this act and commits the same offence again, he will be convicted for the same offence and the penalty will be doubled.
